## About the Problem
Help investors evaluate cryptocurrencies using facebook messenger chatbot. The
conversation should go like this:

### Conversation

1. Welcome the user by using their first name.
2. Ask the user if they want to search coins by name or by ID (Coins ID).
3. Use CoinGecko API to search coins.
4. Retrieve a maximum of 5 coins and let the user select one of them.
5. Retrieve the selected coin’s prices in USD for the last 14 days from CoinGecko.(get it from market chart)

### Specification

1. Don’t use any chatbot framework or service for doing the task.
2. You must handle the flow of the conversation by yourself.
3. Get the best test coverage you can get.
4. In case you are applying for a mid-level position or higher, you are required to add the deployment script or virtualenv provisioning script to the repo.
5. In case you are applying for a mid-level position or higher, test coverage should be 60% or more.

- [x] The implementation was quite straight forward and the team appreciated it
- [x] Overall the documentation was good 
- [ ] The assignment had very less test coverage 
- [ ] Code organisation could have been done better 
- [ ] Considering that we are looking for a senior role unfortunately the assignment didn't raise the bar this time
